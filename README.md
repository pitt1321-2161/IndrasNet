<<<<<<< HEAD
The first goal of this project is to collect public data of the large-scale structure of the universe. The data will then be plotted to see the clustering of galaxies in our universe. In order to understand this clustering, we will simulate the large-scale structure of our universe using a standard computational tool called the particle mesh method. This method is a type of N-body simulation. The method treats galaxies as particles interacting via the gravitational force. A system of differential equations can be set up to model the time evolution of these particles and can be solved using the Range Kutta 4 method. We will compare our simulation results to empirical reality in a number of different ways. We will plot our simulation results for the distribution of galaxies in space and the spatial auto-correlation function will be plotted as well as the power spectrum of the results. Each of these will in turn be compared with empirical reality. 
=======
The purpose of this project is to model the large-scale structure of the universe using an N-body simulation. Our model will be based on data collected from the sloan digital sky survey. The collected galaxies will be plotted as a function of their redshift and location in the universe. This plot will display the large-scale structure of the universe. A theoretical model will then be created to model this large-scale structure. To do create a theoretical model, galaxies will be simulated as particles interacting via a gravitational force. A system of differential equations can then be created, consistent with this model, and integrated to give the time evolution of the N-body system. 

In order to compare the results of our theoretical model to the empirical results obtained from sdss, statistical tests will be done. A spatial autocorrelation function will be used to compare the clusterings of the galaxies obtained from both empirical reality and from simulation. The power spectrum of the data will also be calculated.

Public code to generate data would be used, however there is not enough computing power available for this. The data will then be plotted to see the clustering of galaxies in our universe.
